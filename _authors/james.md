Dr James Pearce, who is based in Melbourne, has been working in data science, statistics and computing since before the term ‘data science’ became popular.

Over his thirty-plus-year-career, James has built data products and delivered sophisticated analytical solutions in diverse industries. He is fascinated by the human and organisational aspects of the analytics life cycle, and how to enhance it to deliver better results. James occasionally blogs about this, as well as adjacent topics.
