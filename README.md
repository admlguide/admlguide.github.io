# ADML Guide

Analytics Design Markup Language (ADML) is a methodology that encompasses 

1. the set of processes required to develop and deliver a successful data product 
2. an accompanying markup language based on JSON

ADML is used to capture the context and codify the outcomes, assumptions, data requirements, resources, hypotheses and learning that comprise the data product, as well as the interrelationships between these components. It relates the data product to its intended and realised business benefit value. The markup language provides a flexible mechanism for defining a schema for the lifecycle of a data product built to address a specific issue and it ensures the resulting data product aligns with an organisationâ€™s strategic imperatives or operational obligations. It is applicable for a spectrum of data product types spanning analytical dashboards to machine learning models. ADML provides a common language for the component processes required to build a data product.
