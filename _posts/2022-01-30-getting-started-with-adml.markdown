So you are keen to get going with ADML? Our set of tools is still in the early days. In the future, expect to see Excel workbooks and other tools to help you manage your data products.

But for now, getting going is pretty easy.

1. Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/admlguide/adml-schema).
2. Review the [ADML schema](https://github.com/admlguide/adml-schema/blob/main/ADML.json).
3. Create your own ADML model for your data product. Follow the [example](https://github.com/admlguide/adml-schema/blob/main/SampleADMLModel.json).
4. Use a JSON schema validator (such as [this one](https://extendsclass.com/json-schema-validator.html))
   to check your JSON model against the ADML JSON schema.
5. Log your issues and feedback on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/admlguide/adml-schema/issues).
